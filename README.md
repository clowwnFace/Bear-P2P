This project was really challenging to me as i got have first hand experience in creating a basic peer to peer application as i need to delve and master it.At first i came to hear terms 
line "topic" , "peerid" and so many other terms and it was really hard.
I used the help of Github codes to create this simple app,overall it's a cool experience for a 17 year old and i love to re-read my code on this project soon enough.

see ya later.
