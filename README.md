This project was really challenging to me as i got have first hand experience in creating a basic peer to peer application as i needed to explore more of decentralised projects.At first i came to hear terms 
line "topic" , "peerid" and so many other terms and it was really hard.
I did few research,faced skme bugs,skimmed through some github projects which are similar to what i did to create this simple app,overall it's a cool experience for a 17 year old and i love to re-read my code on this project soon enough.

see ya later.
